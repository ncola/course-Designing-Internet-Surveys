To run the code, you need to start the MySQL Database server and Apache Web Server (it is recommended to have XAMPP installed). 

First, run 'skrypt_instalacyjny.php' (localhost/skrypt_instalacyjny.php) in a web browser (NOTE! Only once to avoid creating unnecessary databases) on localhost. In the phpmyadmin tab (http://localhost/phpmyadmin/), the "Ankieta" database should appear. 

Next, run the 'ankieta.php' file (localhost/ankieta.php). The actual survey will appear, consisting of 4 pages. After answering and clicking the 'next' button, the answers from that page will be saved in the database, and the next page will appear.
